Our algorithms determine the location of wifi hotspots through trilateration (similar to triangulation) and determine the number of people connected to a given hotspot.

For the mobile app, getting the distance between the user and the wifi router proved to be a challenge. We had to manually calculate the distance using the strength and frequency of the connected wifi signal.

With this sensor we were able to read movement from the accelerometers as well as rotation and direction based on the gyro and magnetometer values.  Also, with the addition of the temperature we were able to add another feature based on the user being able to change the temperature of the chip using their finger.  With this knowledge and the functions we knew from the neopixel ring, we were able to combine the magnetometer readings with the led ring to show the cardinal directions in led format as described above.  Then we attach both the ring and the sensor onto a fabric that acted like a glove, allowing the user to wear the led ring and use it like a compass as intended.  We were first going to make the compass wearable as a bracelet like a watch, but the wires became too difficult to work with and too sensitive to stray movement, so the design changed to a glove.

We instead had to make it into a sleeve because of the amount of wires and space needed for them.  If we tried to cram all the wires into the smaller space of a watch design, we would have risked disconnecting some important wires.  In addition, because the smallest arduino on hand compatible with the sensor had breadboard pins soldered onto them from previous use, the trinket pro arduino didn't fit nicely in the end design layout.", "What's next for Wearable Compass", "On the programming side of things, we had a fair bit of trouble with the leds not shifting correctly.

In US alone, there are 76.4 million Baby Boomers (those born between 1946- 1964) that are ageing as we speak. Other than the progressing health needs, this group is facing a serious issue of loneliness. According to a recent study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, 18% of seniors in US live alone, while 43% report feeling lonely on a regular basis. Lonely seniors are 45% more likely to die faster. With that in mind we came up with LISA, short for Logical, Intelligent, Special Assistant. It is a personal companion and caregiver for the elderly", "How we built it", "LISA would allow its client to live an independent and healthy life. LISA can track its client by using an opencv program and a webcam on LISA, that can track a certain colour. The opencv program can tell where the object is on the screen, differentiating whether the object is on the left side, right side and centre. By doing this, LISA can tell whether it has to turn to make sure the object is still in its line of sight. It would send a signal to the Arduino that controls the main servo, telling it to turn in the correct direction. Furthermore, a secondary Arduino controls the motors of the chassis. An RF key fob sends signals to the secondary Arduino to move the tracks on the chassis.  This give the robot a wider range of movement, allowing it to not only rotate on the spot, but also move around a room. Another key feature of LISA is its ability to remind you of different events. For example, LISA could remind you when to take your medication. It would use our medication dispenser to dispense the medication. It uses a ZX distance and gesture sensor to detect hand movement toward the pill dispenser. When this movement is detected, LISA will dispense the right amount of medication. Moreover, LISA would do regular checkups of the client's heart rate, and based on that, would suggest recommendations. For instance, if the heart rate is too low, LISA might recommend for you to take a walk around the park. Or if your heart rate is too high, LISA might recommend for you to take a break and rest. ", "Challenges we ran into", "Because we wanted LISA to have a real personality instead of being just a screen, LISA would communicate with its clients by talking. When LISA has to tell you something, it would talk to you instead of just displaying a message. On top of that, LISA would occasionally tell jokes to make sure that the client doesn't get bored. ", "Accomplishments that we're proud of", "The main chassis for LISA is from a starter robot kit by Makeblock. It has two motors and four wheels, moving two tracks like a tank. We also used a cylinder made out of cardboard to elevate the base of the laptop. An acrylic platform was used to create a larger surface area for the laptop. Plastic trays were mounted around the robot to store most of the electronics (Arduinos, battery packs, sensors, etc.). A lid of a laundry detergent was used as a container for the medication. ", "What we learned", "A large challenge we ran into during our robot build was with the system of the interfacing of the object tracking and movement. The robot would not be tracking an object when it was making the movement of 'searching' for it. So, instead of having the robot sweep back and forth in one motion while looking for an object, it would make smaller intervals in between. It would then stop in between each interval. So, when an object is not in view, the robot would rotate a bit, stop, search, rotate, and repeat. This way, we are increasing the refresh rate of the searching.", "What's next for Logical Intelligent Special Assistant [LISA]", "Object TrackingWe're really proud of the object tracking because we were able to get it functioning properly in a very short period of time. Furthermore, the movement of the track was very accurate, so that the camera is always looking in the direction of the object.", "Built With", "Medication DispenserWe're proud of the medication dispenser because we used a sensor that we've never used before, the ZX distance and gesture sensor.

Because each update on the developer side has some other passive \"effects\" on the consumer side regarding the economy and time. So Jupiter eliminates just that. It's a custom written JavaScript code, which has a JS Grammar written from scratch allowing for running simultaneous Obj.C commands along with custom JavaScript code in the same console!

You are presented with an instance of the Jupiter console where all commands will be sent to the remote process, executed in a JavaScript instance running inside of that process that has access to Jupiter bridge support, with any results sent back to your local console. This VM instance is shared between multiple consoles. One thing that must be understood while using Jupiter is that it does not simply take your commands as typed and pass them directly to JavaScriptCore. Instead, Jupiter includes a complete implementation of the JavaScript grammar. This not only has improved Jupiter's implementation of tab completion but also allows it to add new syntax. One of the major goals of Jupiter is also JS-Simplifier.
