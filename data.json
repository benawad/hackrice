The internet can be very useful, but due to its anonymity, it can also be used for cyberbullying and for posting vulgar and offensive content. We wanted to develop a way to let online users know whether the content of the page they are visiting is considered offensive. To do this effectively, we incorporated various apis and aggregated metrics that help to better inform the user.\nHow we built it\nSurfShield is a chrome extension. When a user visits a site, the SurfShield icon will change colors to display the level of offensive content on the page with green representing little to no offensive content and red representing a high level of offensive content. When the user clicks on the SurfShield icon, the extension will display an overall score, which is between 1 and 5. This score is averaged from from our four main metrics, which are anger, cyberbullying, profanity, and if users have voted on that particular site, an audience score. \nChallenges we ran into\nWe built SurfShield by creating a Chrome Extension using javascript, html5, and css3. The API calls are made in Python. Using Amazon Web Services, we process the results and then update the UI of the chrome extension with the anger, cyberbullying, profanity, audience score, and overall score. The SurfShield icon also changes colors based on the overall score. \nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nOne main challenge we had was determining where the API calls would be made and the results processed. It was also challenging to integrate the separate parts that we all worked on to create a functioning Chrome Extension. \nWhat we learned\nWe're proud that we've created an extension that will help those who are worried about viewing offensive content on the web. We imagine that many parents would like to have this extension for Chrome, so that there kids can surf the web in a safer environment. The extension is useful for anyone that wants a better and safer experience on the web. \nWhat's next for SurfShield\nWe learned a lot about the Watson Tone Analyzer as well as the Bark API, which greatly assisted us in our goal of determining the level of offensive content on a website. We all collaboratively worked together and used our own knowledge to make the Chrome Extension.  \nBuilt With\nSurfShield has great potential. We believe that in the future, it could allow parents to set it up so that if a site has a score above a threshold, it will block that site from use, so that children can surf the web without their parents having to look over their shoulder.

Wether for academic or industrial reasons, upcoming surgeons have barely any information to look at when learning how to do a specific surgery. We made Project Open Heart to provide an opportunity to develop a better understanding of what techniques an methods to use in a surgery and ultimately lock in the concepts/surgical steps through VR.\nHow we built it\nWe provide a full system to a legitimate surgery. The first part of the system is our \"Nurse,\" Alexa. Alexa helps us retrieve specific tools necessary for our surgery. Through simple requests such as, \"bring me the scalpel,\" Alexa responds by adding a scalpel to your hand in the virtual reality atmosphere. The second part is connecting with the oculus and actually being hands-on with the entire surgery experience. We provide recordings of the surgery so other people can analyze mistakes and show others how the specific surgery is conducted. There is also the feature to record your actions and save them to a file. This file can then be played back at a later date for you or others to see how you performed and what you did. Lastly, you can stream your surgery to any others who want to watch it with our setup. Using firebase, we can sync data between the host and the clients with minimal effort.\nChallenges we ran into\nThe system has two parts: an Alexa app and a Unity app. The Alexa app leverages the firebase api, amazon lambda, and the Alexa API. Once a certain task is called, we call a function in our Alexa app to send an update to our Firebase Database. This allows for live communication between both the Nurse and Surgeon. Now moving over to the surgeon-side. We use Oculus Rift to allow a full hands on experience of an open heart surgery we used 3d models to show a human body: including skin, flesh, bone, and organs. We attached a Leap Motion to the oculus to allow us to track the hand movements when performing a certain gesture in the surgery. When eventually synced with Firebase, we allow for more accessibility of the surgery performed and that is also done through the Unity application.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nSending http requests through alexa was a pain, huge shout out to the Google employees helping us out through that. Acquiring 3d models to use was not an easy task, most of them are extremely expensive. \nWhat we learned\nWe were excited when we knew that we had a cohesive entire system, from recordings to surgical simulations, rather than just building one part. We were also proud of creating something that we both know will be used one day. There has been a problem for centuries of knowledge between hospitals and surgeons not being sent to each other. Project Open Heart, bridges the gap and truly allows others to learn about the surgery and practice it hands-on\nWhat's next for Project Open Heart\nWe learned how to program for Alexa, though it was a complete pain. We had to learn how to also efficiently utilize our threads in the Unity app. Pushing data from Alexa to firebase was also a great thing we learned and debugged to get right.\nBuilt With\nWe want to implement a machine learning layer on top of the Unity application to allow for robust completion of the surgery without humans. We also want to leverage the fact that this application is very unique. Since this project expands to a vast amount of market, we would love to take advantage of that and present this application accordingly.

The message also includes a direction to a website where a log of incidents is journaled, upon which they decide to notify authorities or not. The recordings can be later used to take legal action, identify the offender, and bring him/her to justice. This disrupting approach is supposed to encourage women to report as they have credible evidence to rely upon. Furthermore, it may stop violation on spot or even avoid the assault to be happened, as the awareness of the app among potential offenders may raise the anxiety to be caught. \nAccomplishments that we\u2019re proud of\nWe begun by putting all of our ideas on the table.

In the end, all major features were implemented (Albeit, there will always be hacks to mask the bugs as this is a Hackathon).\nWhat I learned\nLeveraging Google Maps API with zero Android experience.Misunderstanding Intent and Activities derailed me for quite some time.\nWhat's next for AutoChime\nTaken into account, that the half of the team did not have Android or any mobile development experience, and some did not even used Java before, we did an incredible job of supporting each other in the development of code. Teamwork was essential to make autochime become reality.\nProposal\nHeightened awareness of various violence against women issues.

Over the past few months, I have really plunged deep into OpenCV and the different applications of it.\nWhat's next for Beat the Box!\nBeat the Box! is a simple concept. Use your \"controller\" to clear the box from the screen by overlapping your \"controller\" with the box. The \"controller\" is can be your hand, eye, face, or a yellow sticky note. The boxes can move if desired and there are different times you can choose from(i.e. 30, 40, 50 seconds). After time runs out, a score is calculated based on your \"Boxes Per Minute\". If you happen to earn the top score in your controller, the high score will be updated on the description page. See the YouTube video to see it in action!\nBuilt With\nI aimed to combine my two favorite libraries, OpenCV and wxPython. I first created the detection algorithms for hand, face, eye, and the sticky note. Once I had detection of the controller, I needed to create a random box that would pop up so the user could hit it. Then, I needed to have the box disappear once the user hit it and up the score. After that, the OpenCV was pretty much was done. For wxPython, I aimed to make a simple interface with a couple options to make the game more challenging. Those options ended up being \"Box Movement?\" and \"Time\". Box movement gave a random speed to each box and then the box would move across the screen. I added a dropdown to choose between controllers, added a description box of each controller, and then finally used a big Start button to run the options. \nTry it out\nThe main challenge of this project was the controller detection. Fine tuning the hand algorithm was especially painful until I figured out that it was much easier to tune if you had a closed fist instead of an open hand. Another problem was how to figure out if the box was inside the controller. This problem was easier because plenty of other people online had asked about this problem. A physical problem that stackoverflow.com couldn't fix was the slow computer I had. I couldn't run the program at the ideal resolution of 640x480 but rather had to settle for 320x240 which certainly lost some accuracy with the controller detectors.

The Chess++ board includes LED lights below each square, and these lights can be used to display to inexperienced users the possible actions that a certain piece could perform. Once a player picks up a piece from the Chess++ board, it registers that a user has picked the piece up and displays the possible actions the piece can take. This functionality is aimed to assist new users in quickly grasping the rules of chess and to allow them to enjoy the game faster.\nWhat's next for Chess++\nThe Chess++ board utilizes cloud technology in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Uno in order to accomplish its functions.

For English language learners and students with autism, idioms are very challenging. Idioms often have no clear relation to their meaning and are not literal, and thus hard to learn and understand. English-as-a-second-language learners and students with autism can have better conversations and more deeply engage with native English speakers when they have idioms in their vocabulary.\nHow we built it\nThe learner can search for a word or phrase. Idiomatic will return an idiom, its meaning and (will include) a relevant YouTube video. This is valuable for the learner, as they will find the meaning and have a visual reference for the idiom.\nChallenges we ran into\nSet up involved:\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nOur project involved:\nWhat we learned\nWe ran out of time to add in the YouTube API in order for the learner to view a relevant video.

Our team brainstormed many ideas, from utilizing the growing sharing economy to catering to the loneliness of the elderly, but in the end we decided to encourage physical activity, outdoor exploration, and plain old fun. After the release of Pokemon Go, we realized how exciting real-time GPS tracking could make a game, and what better medium than through the iconic and timeless Pac-man?\nWhat it does\nUpon navigating to the website on a mobile device (Chrome works best), a map appears, centered on the user. The Pac-man avatar is at the user's location, and several dots are scattered around along sidewalks and walkways. Upon pressing \"start\", the red ghost appears and begins chasing the user, and the sound effects begin. The user must run around and collect all the dots to get as many points as possibly before being caught by the ghost! \nHow we built it\nWe split the project into three main parts: the ghosts, Pac-man, and the dots. All three tasks utilized the Google Maps API in different ways. \nChallenges we ran into\nAs our name implies, we see lots of potential for other games to be played in this kind of environment.

The plot shows all of the height-width combos available.\nWhat it does\nWhen I'm shopping, sometimes I know exactly what I want, and there are so many products out there that I am sure it exists somewhere. This inspired me to create a better way to search through existing products to find exactly what I wanted and get that satisfaction of receiving a custom-made item, without the time and cost of having something custom made.\nHow I built it\nGoldilocks browse shows a set of products that are all very similar, but differ in a few key attributes. The interface shows one item at a time. The user can then move through the products by indicating that they like the product but want it to be taller, shorter, wider, rounder, etc. for predefined key attributes of a product. The result is a view that looks like a stop-motion film as one product is replaced with the next.\nChallenges I ran into\nThe project involved building the data set of scaled, attributed product images and building the web interface. I gathered silhouette photographs and product attributes from Wayfair.com and processed them with Inkscape and Python scripts. I built the proof-of-concept web interface using a slideshow image viewer as a starting point.\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\nThe most interesting part of this project was coming up with a way to define the product \"nearest neighbors\" in the parameter space of key attributes in such a way that a user could navigate through it. In the end, I generated tables with one row per product and columns for product ID's of products that there were slightly-smaller and slightly-bigger along each attribute, as calculated with a Python script.\nWhat I learned\nFor the visual display to have the stop-motion film look I was going for, I needed images of products with white backgrounds and from identical angles. In the future, it would be ideal to use 3D models of products to render out silhouette shots from identical angles and distances.\nWhat's next for Goldilocks Browse\nGetting three product examples up and running: industrial-style shelves, cylindrical glassware, and white plates. The white plates are particularly interesting because I used a \"roundness\" parameter to sort plates that range from circular to square.\nBuilt With\nThis way of browsing can be very effective, but you need around 50 items to make it look good.

We want to give people the ability to not only see inside their home but also have the ability to control an avatar to complete tasks that was previously impossible unless they are physically there.\nWhat it does\nWith VR goggles you have the ability to have a full-body take-over of Pepper and control its movements, arms, and vision. With this avatar, you can complete tasks at home using Pepper from anywhere in the world. From doing housework, to checking the stove, and even first emergency response, Pepper will be an extension of you while you are not present.\nHow we built it\nTechs we used:\nHow it works\nSo Pepper's api allows for a very limited amount of control over the robot. You can make and open a fist, rotate the palm/write area, and can rotate the elbow and shoulders on 2 axis. The two biggest problems were the shoulder and elbow. How were we going to turn 3 axis rotation into 2 axis rotation. Also, since the Leap motion does not track the upper arm, how were we going to realistically rotate a shoulder joint. \nChallenges we ran into\nDue to the fact that FabCafe did not bring any Myo armbands (even though they said they were bring one/some), we had to improvise and the only other devices that we had access to that had accelerometers were phones. We managed to acquire 2 android phones at 1 am on Sunday and wrote a simple android app that just sends the acceleration data of the phone to a simple web-server on the computer running Unity (the socket server computer). From there every time a new set of values is received it was written to file on the machine. Two files were written, one for each phone. From there, the Unity code would read from the files every frame of the game/whatever this was, and so some fancy black magic math that translated that into the rotational values we sent to the pepper. \nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nThe next part was the elbow, and it was a bit of a pain as well. The way the pepper rotated its elbow as inwards (like in the video (like my movements), and along the forward direction of my arm. The 2nd rotation mentioned is also how the wrist rotates, meaning we had to disable the 2nd rotation for the elbow. So all we did was whenever we sent new data to the pepper as to how to rotate the elbow, we just sent it the same rotational value for that part. We got that data by just taking the hand.Arm.Direction.x of the hand and sending that to the pepper.\nWhat we learned\nFor the wrist, it was pretty simple.

This makes sense, as ASL (American Sign Language) is their first language, and English may be their second. In cases where a deaf person was born outside of the United States, they may know ASL, but not English. In cases such as this, ASL signing is a necessity to communicate. However, most deaf people do have an interpreter with them at all times. \nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe built a chrome extension and Android App that allows a deaf user to highlight a block of text on a webpage, and translate it into ASL. The translation is done one word at a time, using video clips of an ASL interpreter who is signing those individual words. \nWhat we learned\nA backend server, running ruby-on-rails, accepts HTTP requests from a client. The request should contain the text that is to be translated. The server parses the text, one word at a time, and looks them up on the ASL dictionary site handspeak.com. The videos are pulled from handspeak.com and stitched together, and returned to the client as a single video. \nWhat's next for Handy\nThe client can be anything that can send HTTP requests, and can play MP4 videos. For the hackathon, we create a chrome extension that allows a user to highlight any text on a webpage, right click it, and then click a \"Sign with Handy\" menu item. This will open a new web page with the generated video of the signed text. The Android App we developed works in a similar fashion. You can select any text from a web page or another app, click the share button, and then select \"Handy\". The Handy app will open and display the generated video of the signed text. \nSpecial Thanks\nWe had challenges fetching videos from the handspeak.com.

There are some variations on the market that attempt at a more flexible structure, yet those are still restrictive in design, expensive, difficult to mount, and don't respond to specific user needs, such as USB ports or international travel.  So we decided to build an efficient and intelligent power strip that has a more flexible design, provides usage information, and responds to wireless control.\nWhat we learned\nStructurally, the power strip, stripr, is divided into modules that can extend and rotate, giving more room for diverse plug designs.  An LCD display shows real time voltages across each module, and this information is also sent to the cloud where it can be analyzed and the results sent wirelessly to the user's computer or phone.\nWhat's next for stripr\nThe structural parts of the power strip were built by 3D-printing ABS filament, and the modules are connected by adjustable metal rods which house the wires connecting the modules.  We then built a circuit connecting an Arduino with a LCD display, the system also serving as a digital multimeter that measures voltage drops.  The Arduino then sends the voltage numbers to a computing system where it can be stored as a text file in the cloud.\nDomain Name: stripr.tech\nFor the sake of the prototype and due to limitations in size, parts, and time, the Arduino, breadboards, and circuit wiring are attached to the power strip on the outside.  \nBuilt With\nDue to fire hazard regulations, we couldn't actually plug our power strip into a power source, so in order to demonstrate the function of the prototype, we compromised by wiring 9V batteries, with a small rotating camera appliance, internally through the power strip.  We recognize that this isn't exactly how our product will function, but due to the challenge of testing, we decided that using a battery driven motor was the best substitute to mimic a real power supply and appliance.\nTry it out\nIn addition, we faced difficulty in transmitting the voltage data over the WiFi network.  While the system properly provides real time voltage values, it was only able to properly send it to a computer using a direct USB connection.  After hours of debugging and reconfiguration, we attribute this setback to the security of the University of Chicago's wireless networks, since the WiFi requires additional security information the Arduino cannot provide and it probably also has other firewall and security features that would affect connectivity.

It was infuriating to have such an ambiguous model to recreate just from guessing at inaccurate dimensions. Therefore a solution was sought out to create high resolution scans with minimal complexity and cost. The solution found uses no motors to scan a side of an object in 3D. This is accomplished by just using any image taking time lapse device or app. \nWhat's next for got mesh?\nThe device essentially drains a tub of liquid around a solid object of different color to produce multiple 2D traceable contours continuously until a series of \"sliced\" images are formed. An accompanying python script then takes the series of image slices, finds the edge boundary of the object to the fluid, extracts it into a 3D array and outputs the data into a standard point cloud file format.\nBuilt With\nOur first design used a mechanical gearbox and linear actuator to control the relative fluid depth to make the depth based contours. Because we wanted to maintain simplicity, repeat-ability and low cost we switched our design. Our design is solely two tubs stacked on one another with a drain hole in the middle of them. This allows for the fluid to be drained from the top bucket to the bottom, without the use of motors. The only other part is a phone holder securely resting on top of the top bucket to take the time lapse. In the future, higher end DSLR time lapse cameras could be employed with better lighting\nTry it out\nPrimarily we had trouble with tuning the image correctly for the poor lighting conditions, inherent noise and a poor camera. This lead to sub-optimal conditions to produce a good mesh object. A lot of artifacts appeared that were related to glare or shadows that we could not avoid at hack-PSU. Our camera used was a lousy camera from an Android phone as that was all we had which reduced the quality of the image slices. Our other major problem was post rendering of the 3D point cloud as we could not remove the clearly isolated artifacts as the open source program we were using to convert our 3D point cloud files to .stl 3D printable files, MeshLab, crashed too many times.

Click here\nDesktop Screenshot\nInspiration\nMobile Screenshot\nWhat it does\nMath\nHow we built it\nThe idea for our hack came to us as we decided where we were going to set up for the weekend during the hackathon. As we searched crowded rooms across north campus, we knew there had to be a way to get real time updates about how many people are on campus and where they are studying. From this, FireNode was born. \nChallenges we ran into\nFireNode is a real time interior localization platform designed to provide high resolution population density maps of large network infrastructures. FireNode is a learning algorithm utilizing big data concepts - as more wifi hotspot data is collected, FireNode's knowledge of the network and hotspot locations expands to reflect more accurate user densities. Our service has three main components; data acquisition, analytics, and presentation. The data acquisition is carried out by a mobile app that reads GPS and wireless network information. This information is sent to a server where data analytics are performed using custom algorithms. Our algorithms determine the location of wifi hotspots through trilateration (similar to triangulation) and determine the number of people connected to a given hotspot. From there, the analytics data is sent to be presented to the user as a map overlaid with relative population density with a resolution down to individual rooms.    \nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe built a mobile Android app to continuously monitor network and GPS information in the background of the Android operating system. The app scans all available wireless hotspots every 5 seconds to retrieve access point IP addresses, MAC addresses and RSSI/frequency. The RSSI (signal strength) and frequency allows us to calculate  distance from the phone to a wireless hotspot. In addition, we monitor GPS location changes to pair network hotspots with a Latitude/Longitude coordinate. \nWhat we learned\nWe use Firebase as our data management service, sending the real time data outlined above to the Linode Server. This Linode server hosts our java server, which analyzes and processes over a hundred wifi/gps combinations a second to identify the exact location of scanned wifi hotspots. We accomplish this by using a process called trilateration. Each non-linear trilateration calculation use all of the previous data points for a given hotspot, and custom calculations to compensate for the spherical coordinates of the earth. \nWhat's next for FireNode\nFinally, we have a node server running on our Linode host to gather IP connection information from the network. This node server contains an ARP table which allows us to look at all connected devices on the University campus and aggregate IP addresses. Once we have all available IP addresses, we can figure out how many connections each wireless hotspot has and link it to the location data collected before.\nBuilt With\nThere were a couple difficult algorithms that we had to write, involving some difficult mathematics to figure out.  Trilateration functionality on the java server was a difficult algorithm to implement. To get an accurate location out of the trilateration algorithm, we had to figure out how to convert latitude and longitude GPS coordinates to useable distances in a pseudo-cartesian coordinate system. For the mobile app, getting the distance between the user and the wifi router proved to be a challenge. We had to manually calculate the distance using the strength and frequency of the connected wifi signal. In terms of networking, matching BSSIDs to IP addresses in order to find unique connections over the entire network was a big task, given the massive size of the network. It required a lot parsing ARP information and finding suitable _ insights _  from that data.\nTry it out\nWe are proud of our ability to overcome all of the challenges that we ran into while developing FireNode, ranging from the difficult mathematics of trilateration to parsing the massive amount of data about the network.

This holds true not just for physical security, but for cyber security as well. All of your emails and text messages rely on strong encryption to keep your information safe, and that's why we still possess at least some notion of privacy.\nHow we built it\nAt the heart of strong encryption is the ability to generate random numbers.  Unfortunately, the random number generators software developers typically use are purely deterministic -- once the generator has been seeded, all future values are fixed until the next seed. On a desktop, high-entropy data typically comes from a combination of time, mouse movement, and network data. That type of high-entropy seeding is strikingly lacking when it comes to mobile devices. If a malicious entity is able to collect a sufficient amount of generated numbers, they can predict all of the future random numbers generated by your phone. (The crux of it's encryption technology!)  A successful attacker would be able to predict your keys, and read all of your messages.  \nChallenges we ran into\nThe best way around these potential security vulnerabilities is to use a True Random Number Generator (TRNG), which uses hardware to generate numbers, as opposed to a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG), which uses software.  By relying on a high-entropy physical process instead of deterministic software, a TRNG's results are completely unpredictable.  While some specialized devices are equipped with a TRNG, the vast majority of our devices -- for instance, our cell phones -- rely on inferior PRNGs.\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\nRando Shot First is able to quickly generate large amounts of truly random data by extracting the noise out of several photographs taken on an iPhone.  We employ an algorithm that computes a one-way transform over the the RGB values of a number of photos' pixels and other methods for \"harvesting\" the entropy from several pixels. The original picture is completely destroyed, leaving only random noise due to both sensor imprecision and physical randomness.  Each set of pictures are able to generate approximately 10,000 truly random bits.  We ran several randomness benchmarks over the data such as the Wald\u2013Wolfowitz runs test, which confirmed that our bitmaps have high degrees of randomness.\nWhat I learned\nAfter completing its scan, the app itself displays a bitmap representation of the random bits generated as well as a sample 64 bit random integer.\nWhat's next for Rando Shot First\nWe used Swift and Xcode to create the iOS app, grabbing raw, uncompressed images from the camera sensors.\nBuilt With\nWhen we initially ran the app, we only used one picture to generate our random numbers. However, regions of the image with low entropy, such places as by light sources, created large sections of white patterns in the resulting bitmap, not the random behavior we anticipated.  In order to solve this, we have the user take several photos in different positions.  All regions of high entropy are superposed and combine to form a highly random bitmap.\nTry it out\nAdditionally, it took a while to figure out how to have the camera interact with our app and read pixels from the camera since both Swift and the APIs we needed to use have changed quite a bit over the past couple years.

The idea was to require 30 stamps or times we participated each month for full participation credit. Although the class was wary about having participation requirements, the stamp card quickly became a great method of increasing participation and even inadvertently created competition between classmates to achieve the most stamps. I realized that the tangible progress made in the class and the ability to compare it with others was adding a game-like component to learning and participating, even if only with stamps and a piece of paper! Stampify is inspired by this experience and is meant to push the game paradigm further into the classroom to increase engaged learning.\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\nIn a non-intrusive way, Stampify allows students to login to a simple screen where it shows a simple grid that collects stamps or stickers over time at the teacher's discretion. The teacher-facing side of the application allows for an easy way to tap to add a stamp to students' cards to mark off their participation. A leaderboard is shown throughout for top participation that day, week, or all-time as students participate in class to meet their required quotas set by the teacher (currently not able to change quota, update coming soon that will change this). In this way, Stampify is intended to augment classroom learning rather than replace it - it is not an online learning application.\nWhat's next for Stampify\nStampify is built entirely with JavaScript, with frontend and backend parts communicating with WebSockets to make the \"stamping\" live-updating.

She needed to buy a neopixel ring anyway for another project she has been working on, so, we decided we'd use that to make something.  Of the sensors we had, the coolest sensor was a combination of an accelerometer, magnetometer, gyro, and heat sensor all in one.  Thus, the compass was born.\nHow We built it\nWhile the sensor is level, the compass displays north, south, east, and west as colored parts of the ring: blue indicates north, yellow indicates east, green indicates west, and red indicates south.  The lights move in response to the wearer's movement to continue indicating the correct direction.  If the user forgets which color indicates north, he/she can put his/her hand over the sensor, causing the temperature gauge to notice the increased heat, and only north (the blue lights) will show.\nChallenges We ran into\nWhen not using the compass (when the sensor is not level), such as down at the wearer's side, the neopixels display three trailing lights changing colors as they follow around the circle.\nAccomplishments that We're proud of\nWe started off by learning how to use the neopixel ring, figuring out how to address the different leds and how to use for loops to iterate through all the pixels to set each of their values. When we had sufficient knowledge for that part, we then started to work with the adafruit LSM9DS0 3 axis accelerometer, magnetometer, gyro, and temperature sensor. With this sensor we were able to read movement from the accelerometers as well as rotation and direction based on the gyro and magnetometer values.  Also, with the addition of the temperature we were able to add another feature based on the user being able to change the temperature of the chip using their finger.  With this knowledge and the functions we knew from the neopixel ring, we were able to combine the magnetometer readings with the led ring to show the cardinal directions in led format as described above.  Then we attach both the ring and the sensor onto a fabric that acted like a glove, allowing the user to wear the led ring and use it like a compass as intended.  We were first going to make the compass wearable as a bracelet like a watch, but the wires became too difficult to work with and too sensitive to stray movement, so the design changed to a glove.  Also when not in use as a compass, the wearable compass acts as a nice fashion device with a circling led trail of different colors to make it aesthetically pleasing when not in use.\nWhat We learned\nWith the restriction of soldering, we were unable to solder any of our wires and, as a result, the wires had trouble staying connected to each other and the boards, causing the program to freeze. Also, due to the amount of wires, we were unable to follow the original plan of making the wearable compass a watch design. We instead had to make it into a sleeve because of the amount of wires and space needed for them.  If we tried to cram all the wires into the smaller space of a watch design, we would have risked disconnecting some important wires.  In addition, because the smallest arduino on hand compatible with the sensor had breadboard pins soldered onto them from previous use, the trinket pro arduino didn't fit nicely in the end design layout.\nWhat's next for Wearable Compass\nOn the programming side of things, we had a fair bit of trouble with the leds not shifting correctly.  When the leds had to move in the negative direction, each led has a value (0-23), they would skip over a led, causing a gap to form between the four sections and making the compass look off. This took many hours of going over code and trying different ideas before figuring the correct way.  This halted our progress for a while as we had to get through this problem before we could create the others functions of the compass. \nBuilt With\nWe are proud of every aspect of this project.  We are especially proud of getting the sensor to work.  We had a lot of fun exploring its capabilities and adding light patterns for every new feature we learned.

Next we attached the piezo to the Pebble and began tuning the Pebble's frequency to achieve resonance (a very tricky process).

We needed to convert the AC signal to a DC supply so we implemented a wheatstone bridge with four diodes for full-wave rectification. Next, we tested varying smoothing capacitor values and picked the best of what we had. Finally, we were able to power an LED!

While brainstorming, we realized the potential awesomeness in combining tower defense with top-down shooter, and thus Obsidio was born.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nObsidio is a top-down shooter in its core, with a WASD-controlled player who faces in the direction of the mouse cursor and fires a bullet when the left mouse button is clicked. Players, in the interest of killing other players, collect resources known as Praesidia and use these resources for constructs such as turrets and walls. These constructs can be placed anywhere within the world, and it's up to the player to discover the most effective combination of constructs to create an impenetrable base or to wreak havoc on other bases!\nWhat we learned\nWe built this game using the fundamental pieces of our previous game, Tank Anarchy. The game utilizes node.js and socket.io for the physics engine and the multiplayer framework, HTML5 Canvases and CSS for the graphics, and NPM, Gulp, and Bower for project management.\nWhat's next for Obsidio\nWe generally did not encounter large hurdles aside from the initial debate about whether the players should be people or floating vehicles (???). However, as in any coding project, we encountered bugs by the truckload, requiring an inordinate amount of console.logs and error messages. We also encountered sleepiness and failing cognition as it got later (or earlier), taking a large chunk out of potential coding time.\nBuilt With\nWe are proud of everything we've accomplished!

This kit has two galvanometers which are attached to mirrors, the galvanometers drivers, a power supply and a sample display board.  The display board was key to getting the raspberry pi to communicate with the galvanometers.  The galvanometers need a signal from -5 to 5 volts to move.  We originally started by developing a digital-to-analog converter but realized that we could reverse engineer the board that they had provided.  We started off with what looked like the microcontroller (which was unlabeled) and probed the pins until we found the constant 5v and grounds. We did a search for what microcontroller had that particular pin arrangement and found that it was an Intel 5051 or at least a nock-off of it.  We then used the datasheet to prob the pins for the data wires.  After finding which wires we thought were data we were able to find a chip that was a digital-to-analog converter.  With that datasheet in hand we were successfully able to remove the Intel 5051 and replace the signals with that from an Arduino we used to test with.  After the Arduino test was a success we swapped over to Raspberry Pi.  We then started to write a 3d rendering software for the Raspberry Pi to display 3D shapes using the laser projector.\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\nThe inertia of the mirrors caused many issues with using the laser project and having to use delays so that the dot would keep up with the processing power of the Raspberry Pi.  We ran into an issue with paths while developing the 3D engine.  The engine would return the 3d points but not with the dots connected.  We had to develop a algorithm to connect the dots.\nWhat I learned\nDeveloping the software that communicates with the hardware and making it render 3d.\nWhat's next for Laser Projector\nWe learned some of the complications of rendering 3D and communicating over a network.\nBuilt With\nThe laser is currently only green.

In US alone, there are 76.4 million Baby Boomers (those born between 1946- 1964) that are ageing as we speak. Other than the progressing health needs, this group is facing a serious issue of loneliness. According to a recent study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, 18% of seniors in US live alone, while 43% report feeling lonely on a regular basis. Lonely seniors are 45% more likely to die faster. With that in mind we came up with LISA, short for Logical, Intelligent, Special Assistant. It is a personal companion and caregiver for the elderly\nHow we built it\nLISA would allow its client to live an independent and healthy life. LISA can track its client by using an opencv program and a webcam on LISA, that can track a certain colour. The opencv program can tell where the object is on the screen, differentiating whether the object is on the left side, right side and centre. By doing this, LISA can tell whether it has to turn to make sure the object is still in its line of sight. It would send a signal to the Arduino that controls the main servo, telling it to turn in the correct direction. Furthermore, a secondary Arduino controls the motors of the chassis. An RF key fob sends signals to the secondary Arduino to move the tracks on the chassis.  This give the robot a wider range of movement, allowing it to not only rotate on the spot, but also move around a room. Another key feature of LISA is its ability to remind you of different events. For example, LISA could remind you when to take your medication. It would use our medication dispenser to dispense the medication. It uses a ZX distance and gesture sensor to detect hand movement toward the pill dispenser. When this movement is detected, LISA will dispense the right amount of medication. Moreover, LISA would do regular checkups of the client's heart rate, and based on that, would suggest recommendations. For instance, if the heart rate is too low, LISA might recommend for you to take a walk around the park. Or if your heart rate is too high, LISA might recommend for you to take a break and rest. \nChallenges we ran into\nBecause we wanted LISA to have a real personality instead of being just a screen, LISA would communicate with its clients by talking. When LISA has to tell you something, it would talk to you instead of just displaying a message. On top of that, LISA would occasionally tell jokes to make sure that the client doesn't get bored. \nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nThe main chassis for LISA is from a starter robot kit by Makeblock. It has two motors and four wheels, moving two tracks like a tank. We also used a cylinder made out of cardboard to elevate the base of the laptop. An acrylic platform was used to create a larger surface area for the laptop. Plastic trays were mounted around the robot to store most of the electronics (Arduinos, battery packs, sensors, etc.). A lid of a laundry detergent was used as a container for the medication. \nWhat we learned\nA large challenge we ran into during our robot build was with the system of the interfacing of the object tracking and movement. The robot would not be tracking an object when it was making the movement of 'searching' for it. So, instead of having the robot sweep back and forth in one motion while looking for an object, it would make smaller intervals in between. It would then stop in between each interval. So, when an object is not in view, the robot would rotate a bit, stop, search, rotate, and repeat. This way, we are increasing the refresh rate of the searching.\nWhat's next for Logical Intelligent Special Assistant [LISA]\nObject TrackingWe're really proud of the object tracking because we were able to get it functioning properly in a very short period of time. Furthermore, the movement of the track was very accurate, so that the camera is always looking in the direction of the object.\nBuilt With\nMedication DispenserWe're proud of the medication dispenser because we used a sensor that we've never used before, the ZX distance and gesture sensor. It took a very long time to get the gesture working with the servo to dispense the medication. We found out that the sensor has to be facing up towards light for the sensor to work 100 percent of the time.", "like_count": "7"}, {"winnings": ["\nWinner\n                Most Innovative Use of DIRECTV's APIs ~2nd place\n              "], "hackathon": "MHacks 6", "team": [{"url": "http://devpost.com/josephkhawly", "name": "Joseph Khawly"}, {"url": "http://devpost.com/AllenOsgood", "name": "Allen Osgood"}, {"url": "http://devpost.com/imshivs", "name": "Shivani Negi"}, {"url": "http://devpost.com/stephaniemertz1", "name": "Stephanie Mertz"}], "title": "TVTalk", "subtitle": "\n    It's IRC on your TV\n  ", "categories": ["javascript", "html5", "css3", "directtv-developer-platform"], "description": "Inspiration\nWhat it does\nHow we built it\nChallenges we ran into\nPeople like talking about TV shows on social media as much as they do actually watching them.

Trying to find cool events that were happening nearby was difficult; Googling, checking Eventbrite, Meetup, and sending out mass text messages to friends was time consuming and not effective. Keeping up to date with what different friends had planned as the day went on was difficult and clingy. Technology has recently been making major improvements to our day to day lives- so why doesn't it improve our real-world social life?\nWhat I learned\nSail aggregates events from Eventbrite, Meetup, and over a hundred secondary ticket sales websites for users to find things to do with their friends. Alohar is heavily integrated by giving users location-aware contextual notifications if there are events happening around them and if users' friends are there. Additionally, through Alohar, Sail automatically checks people in to events that they had planned on going to through the app so users' friends know that they were physically there. Users can invite anyone in their address book (via Twilio sms) to join them at events or create their own...with a twist. Sail gives users the option to invite friends anonymously to join them at events which drastically decreases the social hurdle to making plans.\nWhat's next for Sail- Experience and Explore\nThe entire iOS app is built natively in Swift. There is a Node.JS server running on Heroku that processes the location data streamed to it via Alohar. The Alohar SDK is integrated into the app to allow users location to be processed in the background so they can have awesome real-world social experiences triggered by their location.\nBuilt With\nI ran into a challenge when I was creating the location-processing engine which sends out contextual notifications and checks people in to events. Because there is a large amount of data being sent to the engine by Alohar, allowing this service to speak to the database of the application (on Parse) in a data-conservative manner took some time. Determining the right gradient of notifications based on the users location data took a while to fine-tune and get beta user feedback.\nTry it out\nI built the entire stack (iOS app, Node server, Parse backend) individually. The location and contextual-aware notifications feel like magic to the few people that have tested the app thus far, connecting them with events around them that they were completely unaware of. Sail provides people with real-world experiences that they otherwise wouldn't have had.

Being a developer, the idea of injecting code at run-time is mesmerizing. Considering the strict eco-system of Apple devices, developers lose a lot of precious time and money, without this facility. Because each update on the developer side has some other passive \"effects\" on the consumer side regarding the economy and time. So Jupiter eliminates just that. It's a custom written JavaScript code, which has a JS Grammar written from scratch allowing for running simultaneous Obj.C commands along with custom JavaScript code in the same console! This is a boon for developers around the world, considering more than $2.4 billion dollars are spent into code maintenance, we save both the developers, time and money and more efficiency and accessibility on the side of the user. Jupiter does just that.\nBuilt With\nWe created the entire custom JavaScript program and grammar in C++, with variable uses of Objective-C++ from time to time for holding the containers. I created the custom parser for listening to replies from the JS code over a TCP/IP connection, and since parser continuously runs in the background, our JS script can inject code into the running application, with the changes being observed simultaneously, since we are debugging in real-time. You are presented with an instance of the Jupiter console where all commands will be sent to the remote process, executed in a JavaScript instance running inside of that process that has access to Jupiter bridge support, with any results sent back to your local console. This VM instance is shared between multiple consoles. One thing that must be understood while using Jupiter is that it does not simply take your commands as typed and pass them directly to JavaScriptCore. Instead, Jupiter includes a complete implementation of the JavaScript grammar. This not only has improved Jupiter's implementation of tab completion but also allows it to add new syntax. One of the major goals of Jupiter is also JS-Simplifier. On the other hand, the awesome frontend has been created in BootStrap and other cool JavaScripts, by Joshua.\nTry it out\nThe TCP/IP connection protocol to send system commands is very technically challenging, and the idea to implement the JS-ObjectiveC bridge for parsing both the JS and Obj.C on the fly in a remote process was one of the most difficult things I had ever done.

We found this comprehensive approach does not exist in any of the symphony\u2019s current marketing approachers (or if it does, it isn\u2019t obvious to the user). We learned that each one of these three components has unique challenges to overcome. We also personally grew, sharing our strengths with fellow team members, and learning from the hackathon community at large.\nBuilt With\nThrough in-depth user and expert research, How do I Symphony will expand to include the experience of attending the symphony in its entirety. Phase 2 will include revamping the ticketing experience, leveraging interactive, connected tools to turn the ticket into a learning portal. Phase 3 will enhance the user experience up until the house lights are dimmed, including further learning opportunities, providing opportunities to prepay for parking and drinks, and letting them know when and when not to clap. Phase 4 will capture the after concert glow of participants to increase customer retention.", "like_count": "4"}, {"winnings": [], "hackathon": "", "team": [{"url": "http://devpost.com/GuitarNick", "name": "Calvin Law"}], "title": "Tabophone", "subtitle": "\n    Device for guitars that writes tablature & music for you automatically.\n  ", "categories": ["qt", "c++"], "description": "Tabophone's Story\nTabophone was originally one of Calvin\u2019s side-projects in university. When he starting playing guitar, he envisioned a robot that can automatically write music for him. While looking for such a robot, he stumbled upon MIDI guitar controllers and was immediately excited about their applications. When he finally got the chance to try one, he found them to be highly technical and not very guitar-friendly. He was also sad to learn that he could not afford one with his student budget. Disheartened at existing solutions, he was determined to create his own device.\nBuilt With\nHe worked tirelessly on the project whenever he found the chance \u2013 sometimes even skipping unimportant lectures. A working prototype known as \u201cFeather\u201d was finally completed in late 2013. At the time, it was simply a bare circuit board taped to his guitar. But it had achieved everything that Calvin had hoped for in his original vision. Eventually, continual efforts to make the device faster, leaner, and more user-friendly has shaped the design of the Tabophone today.

When the user receiving the message logs into his or her account they can see the message, but before they can read it they have to decrypt it by pressing the \"MORSE IT\" button.  When this button is pushed the Morse Bot encrypts the sent message into morse code, Flashing its LED eyes and  beeping using its piezoelectric speaker.

If instead of being on a cramped computer or phone screen, your game was actually projected onto the floor of your room! Even better, what if the player avatar was a real, physical robot? It may sound like science fiction, but we wanted to bring this vision to life. And thus, Funball was born.\nChallenges we ran into\nFunball operates by coordinating between three physical components - a Kinect, a Sphero robot, and a projector - and python code running on a computer. The projector is responsible for projecting the game field onto the floor, and the python code includes routines that correct for distortions caused by the angle of the projector. The Kinect is used to run an image-processing function to detect the Sphero robot as it moves around the field. OpenCV and numpy routines are used to convert the Sphero's location on the Kinect readings to 2D game coordinates, allowing the Sphero to interact with in-game objects.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nGetting the Kinect to properly recognize the Sphero took quite a bit of work. Doing it efficiently to avoid lag was even harder. However, we were ultimately able to piece together a tracking routine that is both accurate and fast.\nWhat we learned\nWhile Funball is a great technical demo, it is also an addictingly fun game in its own right!\nWhat's next for Funball\nWe got a lot of experience with the Kinect API and openCV functions\nBuilt With\nFunball proved that it is possible to get physical and virtual game elements cooperating almost seamlessly.

We want to improve city infrastructure maintenance, and we're starting with something we all know and love, Potholes. \nWhat I learned\nWe start off with the Intel Edison Board. This board runs a python script that read output from an accelerometer. When the z acceleration is beyond a certain threshold, the sensor registers that you hit a pothole, and gets ready to send a request to the database. Our Edison creates a POST request to the digital-ocean database, and registers that you've hit a pothole in the city's database. The city can then see all the potholes encountered throughout the city, and can decide the best plan of action to fix them.\nBuilt With\nThis was our first time working with the Edison board, and hardware hacking in general, so getting used to the basics of electric components was  time-consuming.

First, we take 2 consecutive frames and then divide them into a 10 by 10 grid of pixel regions. We then analyze the colour spectrum and create a histogram representing each region. Then, we evaluate the integral of the Hellinger Distance to find the Bhattacharyya Coefficient. This distance quantifies the similarities between the regions and allows to easily see major changes in the image such as a flash. If there is a 95% change in the image, determined with the Bhattacharyya Coefficient, then we declare it to be a \"flash event\". We then compare this result to the previous 10 results for each regions, if 60% of the frames contain \"flash events\" then the seizing guard is triggered and the window is minimized. We analyze  the display at 30fps, and require of 60% of the last 10 frames to contain dangerous flash events to declare a possible triggering event.
